# SportVision Internship Exploration

During my internship at SportVision, I encountered several intriguing challenges that I've documented here for future exploration and understanding. This repository serves as a personal log of my learning journey, focusing on two primary areas of interest.

## Exploration Objectives

1. **Understanding TensorRT Initialization Methods**
   - **Objective**: Investigate why two different initialization methods lead to divergent inference results.
   - **Status**: Ongoing

2. **Mastering Debugging Tools**
   - **Objective**: Learn and utilize debugging tools, with a focus on the Polygraph tool.
   - **Status**: Ongoing
